      <description>As a creator, the desire to execute is one of the most important things to cultivate for one&amp;rsquo;s self. You can have months pass when you&amp;rsquo;re in an execution state, you feel indefatigable, things get done week after week, culminating in an impressive work product. This is why you work.
But then there are other times when you feel blocked. You wake up in the morning, make no real progress, and go to bed.</description>
