      <description>Dalton Caldwell and Paul Graham have pointed to this idea in startups of &amp;ldquo;having blinders on&amp;rdquo; during idea generation. They have found that founders cannot see what is right in front of their eyes due to blinders - obstructions that block them from seeing the truth. This phenomenon usually occurs when deciding what to work on while pivoting and developing an initial product.
The blinders arise for different reasons. Some examples:</description>

      <title>user experience and AI capability - value isn&#39;t all delight</title>
      <link>http://akshayvegesna.github.io/posts/cap/</link>

      <description>tldr; for many old UX&amp;rsquo;s, there exists an AI capability threshold that amplifies the value prop
Everyone has had a good experience with a product recently. When your AirPods arrive in the mail, you flick the case open and place them tentatively in your ears. The noise-canceling headphones stream Anderson Paak in his distinctive soulful sound. A good product makes an indelible impression on its user - initially in terms of delight but also value over time.</description>

      <description>Here are rough notes (to self) on the copilot story. Source
knew that they wanted to build something using GPT-3 started prototyping: demo&amp;rsquo;s were fabulous demo being good is not a sufficient condition models were not good enough for chat interface - 25% answer that i love, 75% it was garbage code synthesis - synthesizing large function calls - not that satisfying small scale autocomplete with the large models -intellisense dropdown UI UI was not the right thing User would get multiple options for the function body - read and pick the right one use the human feedback to improve the model reasons this was bad hit a key to request it wait for it to come back read three functions and click the right one - too much cognitive effort result was that none of them were good or you didn&amp;rsquo;t know lots of effort on the user but not a lot coming out of it Alex said to use the cursor position in the AST to figure out where you are in the code if you are at the beginning, complete the whole block if you are in the middle, just complete one line automatically generated with no user interaction model was small enough to be low-latency but big enough to be accurate only once all of these pieces were in place did the median new user loved copilot other dead-ends too along the way.</description>

      <description>Spoiler alert: tons of spoilers for the TV show succession
I started and stopped watching succession about three times before I got into it. The reason was simple: all of the characters were unlikeable.
Then I got into it. And the reason why succession is good is because you can see competition for leadership by children who do not deserve it. And that&amp;rsquo;s relatable.
The following sequence occurs in the final episode</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something revolting about unconvincing ambitious people - those that claim there&amp;rsquo;s a billion dollar opportunity somewhere but with transparent naivete and thoughtlessness.</description>

      <description>Someone once asked Gertrude Stein if she was a lesbian. Stein answered no, I just like Alice.
Looking for Alice is one of the most striking pieces I&amp;rsquo;ve read in recent memory. It gets at something that is hard to articulate - some people are distinctive in ways you can&amp;rsquo;t describe. There&amp;rsquo;s not a single theme that binds them, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to talk about their qualities directly. The ones that I have met are aggressive, kind, and thoughtful.</description>

      <title>Laws of Preferences</title>

      <description>Creating general laws in the real world is hard. Talk to an median investor, and you&amp;rsquo;ll hear confident advice about some startup subproblems. And the advice is regularly valuable. But occasionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll listen to a heuristic that is not well qualified or appropriately followed up with the indispensable, &amp;ldquo;but this is just a data point.&amp;rdquo; And you&amp;rsquo;ll ask yourself whether you should change course based on the advice.
The mechanism by which VCs or successful entrepreneurs give confident advice is well understood - they are in positions of power and wealth, and tons of young people look to them for advice.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d rather wrestle grizzlies than compete with Mrs. B.&amp;rdquo; - Warren Buffett
Some people are so good that you know they will do something great. Here we discuss the components of this in a famously good founder - Rose Blumkin. We&amp;rsquo;ll go through some of her exemplary qualities and go through some evidence. Much of this is take taken from the excellent Founder&amp;rsquo;s podcast on the subject.
Intrinsic drive + determination</description>

      <description>When asked why they don&amp;rsquo;t train their own models, new LLM product companies might respond with a smile and a well-practiced &amp;lsquo;GPT-4 works pretty well for our use-case.&amp;rsquo; Beneath this response, there are two underlying risks that these companies must confront
technical execution risk to train one&amp;rsquo;s own LLMs, and product risk in order to make something people want. The technical risk shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be understated. Many ML product companies are made by people in different industries: think lawyers, marketers, etc.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Ride-sharing Markets</title>

      <description>Billions of dollars have been spent on autonomous vehicles in the last decade but we have only recently seen the customer value on the other end. You can now hail Waymo and Cruise as a ride-sharing service in San Francisco. Technologists look at this and see a grand achievement. But business people sneer at the black box of autonomous vehicles sucking in tens of billions of dollars with so little to show in return.</description>

      <description>As a creator, the desire to execute is one of the most important things to cultivate for one&amp;rsquo;s self. You can have months pass when you&amp;rsquo;re in an execution state, you feel indefatigable, things get done week after week, culminating in an impressive work product. This is why you work.
But then there are other times when you feel blocked. You wake up in the morning, make no real progress, and go to bed.</description>
