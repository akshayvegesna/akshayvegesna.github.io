You can choose between rational management of your mind and purposeless drift. Volition and character “‘Character’ means a man’s nature or identity insofar as this is shaped by the moral values he accepts and automatizes.” character comes from your repeated choices “Man is a being of self-made soul.” Every choice leaves its trace.
