      <description>I started and stopped watching succession about three times before I got into it. The reason was simple: all of the characters were unlikeable.
Then I got into it. And the reason why succession is good is because you can see competition for leadership by children who do not deserve it. And that&amp;rsquo;s relatable.
The following sequence occurs in the final episode
Kendall thinks he is going to be the CEO Siobhan thinks she is going to become CEO Kendall thinks he is going to be the CEO Tom is the CEO And through these ups and down, we see a total lack of discipline and principle.</description>

      <title>Unconvincing</title>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something revolting about unconvincing ambitious people - those that claim there&amp;rsquo;s a billion dollar opportunity somewhere but with transparent naivete and thoughtlessness.</description>

      <description>Someone once asked Gertrude Stein if she was a lesbian. Stein answered no, I just like Alice.
Looking for Alice is one of the most striking pieces I&amp;rsquo;ve read in recent memory. It gets at something that is hard to articulate - some people are distinctive in ways you can&amp;rsquo;t describe. There&amp;rsquo;s not a single theme that binds them, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to talk about their qualities directly. The ones that I have met are aggressive, kind, and thoughtful.</description>

      <title>Laws of Preferences</title>
      <link>http://akshayvegesna.github.io/posts/pref/</link>

      <description>Creating general laws in the real world is hard. Talk to an median investor, and you&amp;rsquo;ll hear confident advice about some startup subproblems. And the advice is regularly valuable. But occasionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll listen to a heuristic that is not well qualified or appropriately followed up with the indispensable, &amp;ldquo;but this is just a data point.&amp;rdquo; And you&amp;rsquo;ll ask yourself whether you should change course based on the advice.
The mechanism by which VCs or successful entrepreneurs give confident advice is well understood - they are in positions of power and wealth, and tons of young people look to them for advice.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d rather wrestle grizzlies than compete with Mrs. B.&amp;rdquo; - Warren Buffett
Some people are so good that you know they will do something great. Here we discuss the components of this in a famously good founder - Rose Blumkin. We&amp;rsquo;ll go through some of her exemplary qualities and go through some evidence. Much of this is take taken from the excellent Founder&amp;rsquo;s podcast on the subject.
Intrinsic drive + determination</description>

      <title>OpenAI&#39;s Dominance in the Intelligence API Market</title>

      <description>When asked why they don&amp;rsquo;t train their own models, new LLM product companies might respond with a smile and a well-practiced &amp;lsquo;GPT-4 works pretty well for our use-case.&amp;rsquo; Beneath this response, there are two underlying risks that these companies must confront
technical execution risk to train one&amp;rsquo;s own LLMs, and product risk in order to make something people want. The technical risk shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be understated. Many ML product companies are made by people in different industries: think lawyers, marketers, etc.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Ride-sharing Markets</title>
      <link>http://akshayvegesna.github.io/posts/ars/</link>

      <description>Billions of dollars have been spent on autonomous vehicles in the last decade but we have only recently seen the customer value on the other end. You can now hail Waymo and Cruise as a ride-sharing service in San Francisco. Technologists look at this and see a grand achievement. But business people sneer at the black box of autonomous vehicles sucking in tens of billions of dollars with so little to show in return.</description>

      <description>As a creator, the desire to execute is one of the most important things to cultivate for one&amp;rsquo;s self. You can have months pass when you&amp;rsquo;re in an execution state, you feel indefatigable, things get done week after week, culminating in an impressive work product. This is why you work.
But then there are other times when you feel blocked. You wake up in the morning, make no real progress, and go to bed.</description>
