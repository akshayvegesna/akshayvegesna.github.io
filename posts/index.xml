      <description>When asked why they don&amp;rsquo;t train their own models, many new LLM product companies might respond with a smile and a well-practiced &amp;lsquo;GPT-4 works pretty well for our use-case.&amp;rsquo; Beneath this response, there are two underlying risks that these companies must confront
