You can now hail Waymo and Cruise as a ride-sharing service in San Francisco. Technologists look at this and see a grand achievement. But business people sneer at the black box of autonomous vehicles sucking in tens of billions of dollars with so little to show in return. The crux of the slow progress is locked up in a single word - autonomy. In this essay, we explore this massive technical risk shaping the market for autonomous vehicles and its consequences on the market structure.\nAutonomy Autonomy is simply defined as a car driving itself safely. A software autonomy team is tasked with\nimplementing software capable of making plans based on raw sensor input, and validating that it works. Most of the work there is in 1. The software must understand where all other agents are, and then plan its own path through the environment in a real-time setting (~1s). This is overwhelmingly difficult, and I will argue this by providing examples\na pedestrian jumps out from behind a parked car in front of your car at a blind intersection, you need to creep out in front of the intersection through occlusion you are following a cyclist on a suburban road, how do you decide when to overtake them? These are all challenges where unsafe behaviors put other people at risk. Not to mention, each vehicle and pedestrian exists in millions of small variations and postures, each of which is absolutely required to detect properly for a safe deployment. Solving this problem is a grand challenge of machine learning, state estimation, and real-time software.\nValidation is also a tall task. After designing your software, you must claim that the car is safe with some statistical confidence in order to put your car on the road. The outside view is to have the autonomous robot drive enough miles and see which one is better. Let’s say you want to measure how realistic it is for a rare event like running into a pedestrian for an autonomous vehicle. Humans spent 84 billion hours behind the wheel in 2015, and approximately 7000 people died in fatal pedestrian accidents in 2020 and so, we are trying to develop some confidence on the likelihood of an event that occurs once every 12,000,000 hours. There are tons of alternative ways to do better here, but I won’t get into the details, and just hope this order of magnitude estimate gives you a sense of why you should be worried.\nWhile I will not get into the details of why autonomy is so hard to build in this post, I hope that my thin evidence will allow you to believe it. Companies have spent 1-2 billion dollars from among the best engineers in the world and have still not solved it.\nMarket Structures As I claim that autonomy is one of the most challenging problems of the world, there are those who seem to have solved it. Cruise and Waymo have autonomous ride-sharing deployments in San Francisco, and things are going mostly well. I believe that new entrants will have a really hard time matching the progress from Waymo and Cruise who have apparently solved the problem. Given that the customer offering is mostly identical to rideshare, the only selling points for customers are price, time for a ride, and quality of the ride experience (mostly, just safety). And so, the team that can execute operationalizing the technical feat fast will win the mass of the market.\nDisclaimer: I worked at Nuro on autonomy for three years, before leaving recently. The high-level analysis is only informed by public data.\n",
