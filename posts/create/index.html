<p>That&rsquo;s a nice line. Some products are in crowded spaces that were just a matter of time - the nth frontend authentication product might be one. These will materially change the distribution of wealth in the future but not the future itself. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s clear that there exist companies that change the future - Apple changed the future, OpenAI is changing the future.</p>
<p>Scott Alexander makes a related point here in his piece on <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/billionaires-surplus-and-replaceability">replaceability and billionaires</a>, where he discusses various levels of replaceability in entrepreneurship. Amazon could have existed a few years later without Bezos, but SpaceX probably wouldn&rsquo;t have happened with Musk. And the point he ends with is that the value that you <em>create</em> scales with how materially you positively change the future.</p>
<p>This story says nothing about value capture - companies are vehicles of capital, after all - where profit is the dominant metric. But value capture is upper bounded by creation. And so a helpful condition for a successful company is that the product should change the future.</p>
