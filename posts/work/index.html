Here are some tactical tips for humans trying to work 14 hour days, 6 days a week.\nhave a routine Routines make superhuman feats repeatable. ‘I did it yesterday’ is a great motivation tool.\nI’d recommend to make some of these invariants. For example, everyday:\nWork 1.5 hour bursts, 7 times Run 2 miles Do 1 ‘fun’ programming problem While outputs are what matter, the inputs can be measured and assuming you plan well, will correlate strongly with the output. But if you have a week of bad output, reflect on it and don’t let it happen again.\nmagical thinking is good for teams Ambitious plans are often emotionally resonant for teams. Some examples:\neveryone who does web browsing will use my tool in the future we will solve full self-driving by 2024 we will solve AI for mathematics by 2024 etc. Everyone needs to buy into the plan before you set it.\nset ambitious execution deadlines I mean ambitious on two levels. I’d set goals on the month level, but also on the day level. There is something motivating about having some measurable responsive goal by the end of the day that is extremely responsive.\nnotice when you are losing steam The majority of time you are losing steam, the answer is actually just - buck up. During the minority where the costs are low to distract yourself (be very careful not to fool yourself here), you may divert yourself to a lower intensity productive activity.\nfeel why There are two ways to do great work:\nknow and feel your why, trust this value fn to focus be numb and decide to do it Unfortunately there is some aspect of 2 at play when you are working really hard. But knowing your why is helpful regardless. Everything should be downstream of deep obsession.\nfind your style of obsession A sad truth is that not everyone works on things that they’re obsessed on. My relationship with obsession is up and down - I am certainly not obsessed 100% of the time that I work.\nSo it has to be engineered. Use your more raw feelings of obsession to guide your feelings on the current project. When I shoot a basketball I immediately get into a state of flow. Would rather be doing nothing else. When I look someone in the guy who is guarding me, something comes over me. The ball has to go in the basket. Use this as a bootstrap for your current obsession.\n",

<p>I recently started a startup. The goal most days is to get as much done as possible. Here are some tactical tips for humans trying to work 14 hour days, 6 days a week.</p>
<h3 id="have-a-routine">have a routine<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#have-a-routine">#</a></h3>
<p>Routines make superhuman feats repeatable. &lsquo;I did it yesterday&rsquo; is a great motivation tool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend to make some of these invariants. For example, everyday:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work 1.5 hour bursts, 7 times</li>
<li>Run 2 miles</li>
<li>Do 1 &lsquo;fun&rsquo; programming problem</li>
</ul>
<p>While outputs are what matter, the inputs can be measured and assuming you plan well, will correlate strongly with the output. But if you have a week of bad output, reflect on it and don&rsquo;t let it happen again.</p>
<h3 id="magical-thinking-is-good-for-teams">magical thinking is good for teams<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#magical-thinking-is-good-for-teams">#</a></h3>
<p>Ambitious plans are often emotionally resonant for teams. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>everyone who does web browsing will use my tool in the future</li>
<li>we will solve full self-driving by 2024</li>
<li>we will solve AI for mathematics by 2024</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone needs to buy into the plan before you set it.</p>
<h3 id="set-ambitious-execution-deadlines">set ambitious execution deadlines<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#set-ambitious-execution-deadlines">#</a></h3>
<p>I mean ambitious on two levels. I&rsquo;d set goals on the month level, but also on the day level. There is something motivating about having some measurable responsive goal by the end of the day that is extremely responsive.</p>
<h3 id="notice-when-you-are-losing-steam">notice when you are losing steam<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#notice-when-you-are-losing-steam">#</a></h3>

<h3 id="feel-why">feel why<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#feel-why">#</a></h3>
<p>There are two ways to do great work:</p>
<ol>
<li>know and feel your why, trust this value fn to focus</li>
<li>be numb and decide to do it</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately there is some aspect of 2 at play when you are working really hard. But knowing your why is helpful regardless. Everything should be downstream of deep obsession.</p>
<h3 id="find-your-style-of-obsession">find your style of obsession<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#find-your-style-of-obsession">#</a></h3>
<p>A sad truth is that not everyone works on things that they&rsquo;re obsessed on. My relationship with obsession is up and down - I am certainly not obsessed 100% of the time that I work.</p>
