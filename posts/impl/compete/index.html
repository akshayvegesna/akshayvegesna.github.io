Much of this is take taken from the excellent Founder’s podcast on the subject.\nIntrinsic drive + determination\nBusiness slowed down after the korean war. After taking a 50k loan for 90 days, held a three-day sale and earned 250k. No loans again. Half of her store was destroyed in a fire. Massive discounts on stuff with smoke damage - sold a lot of stuff. Mrs. B worked until she was 104. Was relentless and never took time off. Very decisive and gut oriented. Doesn’t look back. Obsessed with customer\nThe algorithm is to understand what customers want and find a way to give it to them. Furniture customers want low prices. So Blumkin’s approach was to buy cheaply and pass on to customers most of the savings. Best businesses have exceptional value to customers, which translates to exceptional economics for their owners.

Favorite thing to do on a weekend - go to a competitor’s store and plan her next attack. One mental model: if I had ample capital and the right personnel, could I compete? Buffett: Hell no. No Complacency\nHang up “going out of business” from competitors to show the existential risk Immigrant mentality adds to this - Blumkin had a chip on her shoulder.
