  "articleBody": " As a creator, the desire to execute is one of the most important things to cultivate for one’s self. You can have months pass when you’re in an execution state, you feel indefatigable, things get done week after week, culminating in an impressive work product. This is why you work.\nBut then there are other times when you feel blocked. You wake up in the morning, make no real progress, and go to bed. You get sucked into dopamine loops. You see your friends less. You lack motivation. And then, of course, the motivation source doesn’t magically appear in the sky in most cases, and so it continues.\nSome say that taking breaks is the way to solve this. Others say it’s by ensuring what you work on really matters. I think these are both true. The core motivation behind my own actions is some concrete goal that I have judged in advance to be a high enough reward to justify the effort. Taking breaks is helpful because it helps you zoom out and remember the values that lead you to this outcome.\nIn my experience, when you are really motivated by some outcome, extreme effort toward it feels easy. In an ideal world, you can be solely guided by the goal - but in practice, this is hard to achieve. Other sources of motivation are harder to quantify and lean into but powerful nonetheless - some examples are social pressure, service, and aesthetics. For social pressure, the way to lean into this is to have a close community who really understands the content of the work that you’re doing and doing similar work themselves. Have the thing that you want to be the status prize that your peers respect. For the act of service, find people who use things you create and really connect with serving them well. For aesthetics, make and cultivate beautiful things.\nAnother framing of motivation is to avoid things that drain you. A category for myself is playing status games. I think of interviewing for jobs in this category.\nAnd so the lesson here for anyone charting their own path is to consider the framing of maintenance of personal energy. All action comes from motivation and so to maximize action you must maximize motivation. When you plan, try not to be in situations that take energy from you for too long. If you must, then do it for a short while, while trying to lean into your positive sources of motivation. For example, create a community where finding the right job is high status while you are looking for jobs. If others are doing it themselves, then this is even better because you can make the tiny course corrections off of the outcomes of their choices.\nAs you develop, you build some tolerance to situations that you do not like and you can improve your planning in response to your tolerance. But the framing is true nonetheless. At no point will you have an infinite motivation to deal with bullshit.\nI’m a runner, so I have the privilege of observing myself do something hard most days and have a few learnings. First of all, always pre-commit to finishing. The act of pre-commitment has a few consequences. First, you have to work backward from the act of finishing to build the situation leading to it. First, you have to be injury free. Second, you have to be mostly healthy during the rest of the day, or else you are going to feel horrible while you run. These are a couple of decisions that are consequences of the act of pre-commitment. Further, once you keep finishing in this way you realize all the places you could have stopped because it is hard, and you realize you don’t make a conscious decision to not stop most of the time. You just don’t stop.\nAnd in the same way, one can pre-commit to not stopping much in work and force yourself to make the planning decisions to make that by making the appropriate planning decisions on a higher level. In particular, plan to maintain your motivation. Focus on the deep value in your work, lean into your social pressures, value the beauty in your creations, and feel the value that you are adding to others. Avoid status games if you can that are not connected to value.\n",
